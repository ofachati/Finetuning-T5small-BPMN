Then the process is divided into two parallel branches : calculating the total annual budget and estimating the average monthly cost. Once calculating the total annual budget occurs, all departmental expenses must be listed. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed : listing all sources of income and projecting total annual income. The next tasks should then be finalising the budget and registering financial information in a budget spreadsheet. They should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks have been completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: obtaining approval from top management, requesting approval from top management and assigning management responsibilities. Once the approval of top management is achieved, the incorporating of the master budget needs to be done. The process is now completed."

When the setting of target for the approval is completed, it is necessary to review the most recent budget. After reviewing the most recent budget, it must be done to define three to five goals. When defining three to five goals is completed the next tasks should be calculating the annual budget, listing all departmental expenses and estimating the average monthly cost. They should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: listing all sources of income, projecting annual total revenue. After that, the finalizing of the budget needs to be done. Once the budget is finalized, one or more of the following pathways should be executed : incorporating into the master budget and obtaining approval from top management.

When the setting of the target date for approval is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: evaluating any significant variances, reviewing the most recent budget. After that, you need to determine ways to attain the targets. After determining ways of achieving the goals, the monthly average cost should be calculated. Once the average monthly cost is estimated, projecting the total annual income is needed. When estimating annual total income is completed, you need to record financial information in a budget spreadsheet.

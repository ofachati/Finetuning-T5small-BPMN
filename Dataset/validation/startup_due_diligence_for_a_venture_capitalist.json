Once all the pre-tasks have been carried out, you need to review the expertise. After reviewing expertise, one or more of the following steps should be executed : checking cash flow, checking exit strategy. Following the checking of cash flow, quarterly projections should be done. Afterwards, the market is projected. Once projecting the market share occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: checking past lawsuits, checking insurance and checking trademarks.

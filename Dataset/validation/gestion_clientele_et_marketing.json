When basic information is recorded, the impact of the cancellation needs to be quantified. When the process of quantifying the impact of the cancellation has been completed, you need to send an email to them. Those who send them an email should ask open-ended questions. After answering open-ended questions, they should be presented with a special offer. When a special offer is presented to the customer, you need to record their decision. Once the customer has recorded their decision, if there are any other concerns should be done. After asking if they have any other concerns, the process is split into 2 branches : noticing important learnings from the conversation and sending the learnings to the appropriate managers. The process is now finished."

After answering open-ended questions, one or more of the following path(s) should be applied: presenting them with a special offer, describing your ideas to increase value. You then need to thank them for their time and feedback. After thanking them for their time and feedback, i asked if they had other questions that need to be done. Once anyone asks if they have other concerns the next tasks should be sending learnings to appropriate managers and noting important learnings from the conversation, they should be done in parallel.

Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following steps should be taken: finding the source of the problem, asking open-ended questions. After identifying the root cause of the problem, you need to summarize why they want to leave. So it has to be done and they must then be presented with a special offer. Once a special offer occurs to the customer, the record needs to be done. After the customer has recorded his decision, the customer has to ask if they have any other concerns. When asked if they have any other concerns, you should send learnings to the appropriate managers. The process is completed now."

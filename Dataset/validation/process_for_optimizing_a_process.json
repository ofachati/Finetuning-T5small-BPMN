After confirming the basic information, the process should be evaluated for performance. Once the performance of the process happens, it is necessary to note which steps can be automated. After identifying which steps can be automated, you need to write the potential process improvements. After writing the potential processing improvements, approval for the improvements should be done. Ultimately, after getting approval for the improvements to be made, it needs to be defining what would make the improvements successful. When defining what would make improvements successful is completed, communication of process changes needs to be done. The process is now completed."

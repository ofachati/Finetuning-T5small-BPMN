When the ID test is completed at the lender, the process is divided into 2 parallel branches : completing the loan application by the borrower and receiving the application by the credit department. Once all pre-tasks are executed you need to send application back to the applicant. Once a copy of the application is sent back to the applicant, one or more of the following paths should be executed: beginning the underwriting process, checking the credit score and risk score. Then the process is split into 3 parallel branches : reducing the loan amount, changing the interest rate and approving the loan application. Once all pre-tasks are executed, you need to receive the funds. The process is now completed."

Following, one or more of the following paths should be executed: listing all income sources and projecting the total annual income. Afterwards, you need to record financial data in a budget sheet. Once financial data is recorded in a budget spreadsheet, you need to assign management responsibility. The process has now been finished."

After defining three to five goals, the ways of achieving the goals should be done. After that, you have to calculate the total annual budget. After calculating the annual budget total, one or more of the following paths should be executed: listing all sources of income, projecting total annual income.
